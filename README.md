# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modeling-of-CO2-Emissions

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a dataset aimed at understanding and predicting CO2 emissions across different countries. The project is divided into two main phases: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML) modeling.

## Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
The initial phase focuses on exploring the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships between variables. Key steps include:

### Data Preprocessing:

Verification and conversion of variable types, including transforming the Year variable into a qualitative one.
Handling and converting the Density (P/Km2) variable to a numeric type to avoid data loss.
Calculation and analysis of missing data percentages across variables, with a strategic removal of variables with significant missing values.
### Descriptive Analysis:

Unidimensional descriptive analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of individual variables.
Visualization of CO2 emission heterogeneity among countries, identifying the top 5 CO2 emitters.
### Multidimensional Analysis:

Exploration of relationships between quantitative variables using scatterplots and correlation matrices.
Application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and interpret key contributing factors.
## Phase 2: Machine Learning Modeling
In this phase, the project transitions to predictive modeling with the goal of accurately predicting CO2 emissions (Value-co2-emissions) using various ML algorithms:

### Data Splitting:

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with 20% allocated for testing to evaluate model performance.
### Model Comparison:

Performance comparison across multiple models, including Linear Regression (with/without variable selection and penalization), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Boosting, and Neural Networks.
Parameter tuning using cross-validation to optimize model performance, followed by an analysis of results to determine the effectiveness of nonlinear models.
### Model Evaluation:

Final evaluation of optimized models on the test set to identify the best-performing model.
Interpretation of results, linking back to the initial exploratory analysis to assess the consistency of findings.
### Advanced Steps:

Exploration of missing data imputation techniques and re-evaluation of model performance with the imputed dataset.
This project serves as a comprehensive example of the data science workflow, from initial data exploration to advanced machine learning modeling, aimed at deriving actionable insights and predictive capabilities for CO2 emissions.
